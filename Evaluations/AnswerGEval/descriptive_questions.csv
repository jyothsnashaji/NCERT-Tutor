(i) Gaseous solution:  The solution in which the solvent is a gas is called a gaseous solution. In these solutions, the solute may be liquid,  solid, or gas. For example, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gas is a gaseous solution.  (ii) Liquid solution:  The solution in which the solvent is a liquid is known as a liquid solution.

Solubility,How many mL of 0.1 M HCl are required to react completely with 1 g mixture of Na2CO3 and  NaHCO3containing equimolar amounts of both?,"Let the amount of Na2CO3 in the mixture be x g.  Then, the amount of NaHCO3 in the mixture is (1 - x) g.  Molar mass of Na2CO3 = 2 × 23 + 1 × 12 + 3 × 16  = 106 g mol - 1   Number of moles Na2CO3    Molar mass of NaHCO3 = 1 × 23 + 1 × 1 × 12 + 3 × 16  = 84 g mol - 1  Number of moles of NaHCO3    According to the question,    ⇒ 84x = 106 - 106x  ⇒ 190x = 106  ⇒ x = 0.5579  Therefore, number of moles of Na2CO3    = 0.0053 mol  And, number of moles of NaHCO3          = 0.0053 mol  HCl reacts with Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 according to the following equation.      1 mol of Na2CO3 reacts with 2 mol of HCl.  Therefore, 0.0053 mol of Na2CO3 reacts with 2 × 0.0053 mol = 0.0106 mol.  Similarly, 1 mol of NaHCO3 reacts with 1 mol of HCl.  Therefore, 0.0053 mol of NaHCO3 reacts with 0.0053 mol of HCl.  Total moles of HCl required = (0.0106 + 0.0053) mol  = 0.0159 mol  In 0.1 M of HCl,  0.1 mol of HCl is preset in 1000 mL of the solution.  Therefore, 0.0159 mol of HCl is present in    = 159 mL of the solution  Hence, 159 mL of 0.1 M of HCl is required to react completely with 1 g mixture of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, containing  equimolar amounts of both."
Vapour Pressure of Liquid Solutions,What role does the molecular interaction play in a solution of alcohol and water?,"In pure alcohol and water, the molecules are held tightly by a strong hydrogen bonding. The interaction between the  molecules of alcohol and water is weaker than alcohol-alcohol and water-water interactions. As a result, when alcohol  and water are mixed, the intermolecular interactions become weaker and the molecules can easily escape. This  increases the vapour pressure of the solution, which in turn lowers the boiling point of the resulting solution."
Vapour Pressure of Liquid Solutions,Why do gases always tend to be less soluble in liquids as the temperature is raised?,"Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with an increase in temperature. This is because dissolution of gases in  liquids is an exothermic process.          Therefore, when the temperature is increased, heat is supplied and the equilibrium shifts backwards, thereby  decreasing the solubility of gases."
Vapour Pressure of Liquid Solutions,State Henry's law and mention some important applications?,"Henry's law states that partial pressure of a gas in the vapour phase is proportional to the mole fraction of  the gas in the solution. If p is the partial pressure of the gas in the vapour phase and x is the mole fraction of the  gas, then Henry's law can be expressed as:  p = KH x  Where,  KH is Henry's law constant  Some important applications of Henry's law are mentioned below.  (i) Bottles are sealed under high pressure to increase the solubility of CO2 in soft drinks and soda water.  (ii) Henry's law states that the solubility of gases increases with an increase in pressure. Therefore, when a scuba  diver dives deep into the sea, the increased sea pressure causes the nitrogen present in air to dissolve in his blood in  great amounts. As a result, when he comes back to the surface, the solubility of nitrogen again decreases and the  dissolved gas is released, leading to the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood. This results in the blockage of  capillaries and leads to a medical condition known as 'bends' or 'decompression sickness'.  Hence, the oxygen tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air and diluted with helium to avoid bends.  (iii) The concentration of oxygen is low in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes such as climbers.  This is because at high altitudes, partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at ground level. Low-blood oxygen  causes climbers to become weak and disables them from thinking clearly. These are symptoms of anoxia."

If the solution  contains 5.00 x 10-2 g of ethane, then what shall be the partial pressure of the gas?","Molar mass of ethane (C2H6) = 2 × 12 + 6 × 1  = 30 g mol - 1  Number of moles present in 6.56 × 10 - 3 g of ethane   = 2.187 × 10 - 4 mol  Let the number of moles of the solvent be x.  According to Henry's law,        p = KHx"
Ideal and Non-ideal Solutions,What is meant by positive and negative deviations from Raoult's law and how is the sign of ΔsolHrelated to  positive and negative deviations from Raoult's law?,"According to Raoult's law, the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in any solution is directly  proportional to its mole fraction. The solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are  known as ideal solutions. The solutions that do not obey Raoult's law (non-ideal solutions) have vapour pressures  either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult's law. If the vapour pressure is higher, then the solution is said to  exhibit positive deviation, and if it is lower, then the solution is said to exhibit negative deviation from Raoult's law.    Vapour pressure of a two-component solution showing positive deviation from Raoult's law          Vapour pressure of a two-component solution showing negative deviation from Raoult's law  In the case of an ideal solution, the enthalpy of the mixing of the pure components for forming the solution is zero.  ΔsolH= 0  In the case of solutions showing positive deviations, absorption of heat takes place.  ∴ΔsolH= Positive  In the case of solutions showing negative deviations, evolution of heat takes place.  ∴ΔsolH= Negative"

Abnormal Molar Masses,"The depression in freezing point of water observed for the same amount of acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid  and trifluoroacetic acid increases in the order given above. Explain briefly.    ","Among H, Cl, and F, H is least electronegative while F is most electronegative. Then, F can withdraw electrons  towards itself more than Cl and H. Thus, trifluoroacetic acid can easily lose H+ ions i.e., trifluoroacetic acid ionizes to  the largest extent. Now, the more ions produced, the greater is the depression of the freezing point. Hence, the  depression in the freezing point increases in the order:  Acetic acid < trichloroacetic acid < trifluoroacetic acid"

Galvanic Cells,Define conductivity and molar conductivity for the solution of an electrolyte. Discuss their variation with  concentration.,"Conductivity of a solution is defined as the conductance of a solution of 1 cm in length and area of cross-section 1 sq.  cm. The inverse of resistivity is called conductivity or specific conductance. It is represented by the symbolÃŽÂº. If ÃÂ  is resistivity, then we can write:    The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance (G) of one unit volume of solution kept  between two platinum electrodes with the unit area of cross-section and at a distance of unit length.  i.e.,    (Since a = 1, l = 1)  Conductivity always decreases with a decrease in concentration, both for weak and strong electrolytes.

In the +1 oxidation state, an electron is removed from the s-orboital. However, in the +2 oxidation state, an  electron is removed from the d-orbital.

In all transition metals (except Zn,  electronic configuration: 3d10 4s2), there are some unpaired electrons that account for their stronger metallic bonding.

Sublimation: The energy required for converting one mole of an atom from the solid state to the gaseous state.    2. Ionization: The energy required to take out electrons from one mole of atoms in the gaseous state.    3. Hydration: The energy released when one mole of ions are hydrated.    Now, copper has a high energy of atomization and low hydration energy. Hence, the Eθ(M2+/M) value for copper is  positive."
Position in the Periodic Table,How would you account for the irregular variation of ionization enthalpies (first and second) in the first series  of the transition elements?,"Ionization enthalpies are found to increase in the given series due to a continuous filling of the inner d-orbitals. The  irregular variations of ionization enthalpies can be attributed to the extra stability of configurations such as d0, d5, d10.  Since these states are exceptionally stable, their ionization enthalpies are very high.  In case of first ionization energy, Cr has low ionization energy. This is because after losing one electron, it attains the  stable configuration (3d5). On the other hand, Zn has exceptionally high first ionization energy as an electron has to  be removed from stable and fully-filled orbitals (3d10 4s2).  Second ionization energies are higher than the first since it becomes difficult to remove an electron when an electron  has already been taken out. Also, elements like Cr and Cu have exceptionally high second ionization energies as  after losing the first electron, they have attained the stable configuration (Cr+: 3d5 and Cu+: 3d10). Hence, taking out  one electron more from this stable configuration will require a lot of energy."

Therefore, Cr2+ is a better reducing agent that Fe3+."
General Properties of the Transition Elements,Explain why Cu+ ion is not stable in aqueous solutions?,"In an aqueous medium, Cu2+ is more stable than Cu+.

It disproportionates to give Cu2+ and Cu."
General Properties of the Transition Elements,Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction. Why?,"In actinoids, 5f orbitals are filled. These 5f orbitals have a poorer shielding effect than 4f orbitals (in lanthanoids).  Thus, the effective nuclear charge experienced by electrons in valence shells in case of actinoids is much more that  that experienced by lanthanoids.

Position in the Periodic Table,      Why are Mn2+compounds more stable than Fe2+ towards oxidation to their +3 state?,"Electronic configuration of Mn2+is [Ar]18 3d5.  Electronic configuration of Fe2+is [Ar]18 3d6.  It is known that half-filled and fully-filled orbitals are more stable. Therefore, Mn in (+2) state has a  stabled5configuration. This is the reason Mn2+shows resistance to oxidation to Mn3+. Also, Fe2+has 3d6configuration  and by losing one electron, its configuration changes to a more stable 3d5configuration. Therefore, Fe2+easily gets  oxidized to Fe+3oxidation state."
Position in the Periodic Table,Explain briefly how +2 state becomes more and more stable in the first half  of the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number?,"The oxidation states displayed by the first half of the first row of transition metals are given in the table below.

Also, on moving from Sc to Mn,  the atomic number increases from 21 to 25. This means the number of electrons in the 3d-orbital also increases from  1 to 5.  Sc (+2) = d1  Ti (+2) = d2  V (+2) = d3  Cr (+2) = d4  Mn (+2) = d5        +2 oxidation state is attained by the loss of the two 4selectrons by these metals. Since the number of delectrons in  (+2) state also increases from Ti(+2) to Mn(+ 2), the stability of +2 state increases (as d-orbital is becoming more and  more half-filled). Mn (+2) has d5electrons (that is half-filled dshell, which is highly stable)."
Position in the Periodic Table,To what extent do the electronic configurations decide the stability of  oxidation states in the first series of the transition elements? Illustrate  your answer with examples.,"The elements in the first-half of the transition series exhibit many oxidation states with Mn exhibiting maximum  number of oxidation states (+2 to +7). The stability of +2 oxidation state increases with the increase in atomic  number. This happens as more electrons are getting filled in the d-orbital. However, Sc does not show +2 oxidation  state. Its electronic configuration is 4s23d1. It loses all the three electrons to form Sc3+. +3 oxidation state of Sc is very  stable as by losing all three electrons, it attains stable noble gas configuration, [Ar]. Ti (+ 4) and V(+5) are very stable  for the same reason. For Mn, +2 oxidation state is very stable as after losing two electrons, its d-orbital is exactly half- filled, [Ar] 3d5."

(ii) Chromate,    Oxidation state of Cr is + 6.  (iii) Permanganate,    Oxidation state of Mn is + 7."
Electronic Configurations of the d-Block Elements,What is lanthanoid contraction? What are the consequences of lanthanoid  contraction?,"As we move along the lanthanoid series, the atomic number increases gradually by one. This means that the number  of electrons and protons present in an atom also increases by one. As electrons are being added to the same shell,  the effective nuclear charge increases. This happens because the increase in nuclear attraction due to the addition of  proton is more pronounced than the increase in the interelectronic repulsions due to the addition of electron. Also,  with the increase in atomic number, the number of electrons in the 4forbital also increases. The 4felectrons have poor  shielding effect. Therefore, the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons increases. Consequently,  the attraction of the nucleus for the outermost electrons increases. This results in a steady decrease in the size of  lanthanoids with the increase in the atomic number. This is termed as lanthanoid contraction.  Consequences of lanthanoid contraction  (i) There is similarity in the properties of second and third transition series.  ii.  Separation of lanthanoids is possible due to lanthanide contraction.  (iii) It is due to lanthanide contraction that there is variation in the basic strength of lanthanide hydroxides. (Basic  strength decreases from La(OH)3to Lu(OH)3.)"
Electronic Configurations of the d-Block Elements,What are the characteristics of the transition elements and why are they  called transition elements? Which of the d-block elements may not be  regarded as the transition elements?,"Transition elements are those elements in which the atoms or ions (in stable oxidation state) contain partially filled d- orbital. These elements lie in the d-block and show a transition of properties between s-block and p-block. Therefore,  these are called transition elements.  Elements such as Zn, Cd, and Hg cannot be classified as transition elements because these have completely filled d- subshell."
General Properties of the Transition Elements,In what way is the electronic configuration of the transition elements different  from that of the non-transition elements?,"Transition metals have a partially filled d-orbital. Therefore, the electronic configuration of transition elements is (n -  1)d1-10ns0-2.  The non-transition elements either do not have a d-orbital or have a fully filled d-orbital. Therefore, the electronic  configuration of non-transition elements is ns1-2or ns2np1-6."
General Properties of the Transition Elements,What are the different oxidation states exhibited by the lanthanoids?,"In the lanthanide series, +3 oxidation state is most common i.e., Ln(III) compounds are predominant. However, +2  and +4 oxidation states can also be found in the solution or in solid compounds."
General Properties of the Transition Elements,Explain giving reasons:  (i) Transition metals and many of their compounds show paramagnetic  behaviour.  (ii) The enthalpies of atomisation of the transition metals are high.  (iii) The transition metals generally form coloured compounds.  (iv) Transition metals and their many compounds act as good catalyst.,"(i) Transition metals show paramagnetic behaviour. Paramagnetism arises due to the presence of unpaired electrons  with each electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular        momentum. However, in the first transition series, the orbital angular momentum is quenched. Therefore, the  resulting paramagnetism is only because of the unpaired electron.  (ii) Transition elements have high effective nuclear charge and a large number of valence electrons. Therefore, they  form very strong metallic bonds. As a result, the enthalpy of atomization of transition metals is high.  (iii) Most of the complexes of transition metals are coloured. This is because of the absorption of radiation from  visible light region to promote an electron from one of the d-orbitals to another. In the presence of ligands, the d- orbitals split up into two sets of orbitals having different energies. Therefore, the transition of electrons can take place  from one set toanother. The energy required for these transitions is quite small and falls in the visible region of  radiation. The ions of transition metals absorb the radiation of a particular wavelength and the rest is reflected,  imparting colour to the solution.  (iv) The catalytic activity of the transition elements can be explained by two basic facts.  (a) Owing to their ability to show variable oxidation states and form complexes, transition metals form unstable  intermediate compounds. Thus, they provide a new path with lower activation energy, Ea, for the reaction.  (b) Transition metals also provide a suitable surface for the reactions to occur."
Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements,What are interstitial compounds? Why are such compounds well known for  transition metals?,"Transition metals are large in size and contain lots of interstitial sites. Transition elements can trap atoms of other  elements (that have small atomic size), such as H, C, N, in the interstitial sites of their crystal lattices. The resulting  compounds are called interstitial compounds."
Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements,How is the variability in oxidation states of transition metals different from  that of the non-transition metals? Illustrate with examples.,"In transition elements, the oxidation state can vary from +1 to the highest oxidation state by removing all its valence  electrons.

Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements,Describe the preparation of potassium dichromate from iron chromite ore.  What is the effect of increasing pH on a solution of potassium dichromate?    ,"Potassium dichromate is prepared from chromite ore  in the following steps.  Step (1): Preparation of sodium chromate    Step (2): Conversion of sodium chromate into sodium dichromate    Step(3): Conversion of sodium dichromate to potassium dichromate    Potassium dichromate being less soluble than sodium chloride is obtained in the form of orange coloured crystals and  can be removed by filtration.

The Lanthanoids,Describe the oxidising action of potassium dichromate and write the ionicequations for its reaction with:  (i) iodide (ii) iron(II) solution and (iii) H2S,"acts as a very strong oxidising agent in the acidic medium.     takes up electrons to get reduced and acts as an oxidising agent. The reaction of K2Cr2O7with other  iodide, iron (II) solution, and H2S are given below.  (i)   oxidizes iodide to iodine.    (ii)   oxidizes iron (II) solution to iron (III) solution i.e., ferrous ions to ferric ions.          (iii)   oxidizes H2S to sulphur."
The Lanthanoids,Describe the preparation of potassium permanganate. How does the acidifiedpermanganate solution react  with (i) iron(II) ions (ii) SO2and (iii) oxalic acid?  Write the ionic equations for the reactions.,"Potassium permanganate can be prepared from pyrolusite (MnO2). The ore is fused with KOH in the presence of  either atmospheric oxygen or an oxidising agent, such as KNO3or KClO4, to give K2MnO4.    The green mass can be extracted with water and then oxidized either electrolytically or by passing chlorine/ozone into  the solution.  Electrolytic oxidation    At anode, manganate ions are oxidized to permanganate ions.    Oxidation by chlorine    Oxidation by ozone          (i) Acidified KMnO4solution oxidizes Fe (II) ions to Fe (III) ions i.e., ferrous ions to ferric ions.    (ii) Acidified potassium permanganate oxidizes SO2 to sulphuric acid.    (iii) Acidified potassium permanganate oxidizes oxalic acid to carbon dioxide."
The Lanthanoids,"For M2+/M and M3+/M2+ systems, the   values for some metals are as follows:  Cr2+/Cr -0.9V  Cr3/Cr2+ -0.4 V  Mn2+/Mn -1.2V  Mn3+/Mn2+ +1.5 V  Fe2+/Fe -0.4V  Fe3+/Fe2+ +0.8 V  Use this data to comment upon:  (i) The stability of Fe3+in acid solution as compared to that of Cr3+or Mn3+ and  (ii) The ease with which iron can be oxidised as compared to a similar process for either chromium or  manganese metal.","(i) The   value for Fe3+/Fe2+  is higher than that for Cr3+/Cr2+and lower than that for Mn3+/Mn2+. So, the reduction of  Fe3+to Fe2+is easier than the reduction of Mn3+to Mn2+, but not as easy as the reduction ofCr3+ to Cr2+. Hence, Fe3+is        more stable than Mn3+, but less stable than Cr3+. These metal ions can be arranged in the increasing order of their  stability as: Mn3+< Fe3+< Cr3+  (ii) The reduction potentials for the given pairs increase in the following order.  Mn2+ / Mn < Cr2+ / Cr < Fe2+ /Fe  So, the oxidation of Fe to Fe2+is not as easy as the oxidation of Cr to Cr2+and the oxidation of Mn to Mn2+. Thus, these  metals can be arranged in the increasing order of their ability to get oxidised as: Fe < Cr < Mn"
The Lanthanoids,"Predict which of the following will be coloured in aqueous solution? Ti3+, V3+,  Cu+, Sc3+, Mn2+, Fe3+ and Co2+. Give reasons for each.","Only the ions that have electrons in d-orbital and in which d-d transition is possible will be coloured. The ions in  which d-orbitals are empty or completely filled will be colourless as no d-d transition is possible in those  configurations.

All other ions, except Sc3+ and Cu+, will be coloured in aqueous solution because of d - d transitions."
The Lanthanoids,Compare the stability of +2 oxidation state for the elements of the first transition series.,"Sc      +3          Ti  +1  +2  +3  +4              V  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5      Cr  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5  +6    Mn  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5  +6  +7  Fe  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5  +6    Co  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5      Ni  +1  +2  +3  +4        Cu  +1  +2  +3          Zn    +2            From the above table, it is evident that the maximum number of oxidation states is shown by Mn, varying from +2 to  +7. The number of oxidation states increases on moving from Sc to Mn. On moving from Mn to Zn, the number of  oxidation states decreases due to a decrease in the number of available unpaired electrons. The relative stability of  the +2 oxidation state increases on moving from top to bottom. This is because on moving from top to bottom, it  becomes more and more difficult to remove the third electron from the d-orbital."
The Actinoids,Compare the chemistry of actinoids with that of the lanthanoids with specialreference to:  (i) electronic configuration (iii) oxidation state  (ii) atomic and ionic sizes and (iv) chemical reactivity.,"(i) Electronic configuration  The general electronic configuration for lanthanoids is [Xe]544f0-145d0-16s2and that for actinoids is [Rn]865f1-146d0-17s2.  Unlike 4forbitals, 5f orbitals are not deeply buried and participate in bonding to a greater extent.  (ii) Oxidation states  The principal oxidation state of lanthanoids is (+3). However, sometimes we also encounter oxidation states of + 2  and + 4. This is because of extra stability of fully-filled and half-filled orbitals. Actinoids exhibit a greater range of  oxidation states. This is because the 5f, 6d, and 7slevels are of comparable energies. Again, (+3) is the principal  oxidation state for actinoids. Actinoids such as lanthanoids have more compounds in +3 state than in +4 state.  (iii) Atomic and lonic sizes  Similar to lanthanoids, actinoids also exhibit actinoid contraction (overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii). The  contraction is greater due to the poor shielding effect of 5forbitals.  iv.  Chemical reactivity  In the lanthanide series, the earlier members of the series are more reactive. They have reactivity that is comparable  to Ca. With an increase in the atomic number, the lanthanides start behaving similar to Al. Actinoids, on the other  hand, are highly reactive metals, especially when they are finely divided. When they are added to boiling water, they        give a mixture of oxide and hydride. Actinoids combine with most of the non-metals at moderate temperatures.  Alkalies have no action on these actinoids. In case of acids, they are slightly affected by nitric acid (because of the  formation of a protective oxide layer)."
The Actinoids,"How would you account for the following:  (i) Of the d4species, Cr2+is strongly reducing while manganese(III) is strongly oxidising.  (ii) Cobalt(II) is stable in aqueous solution but in the presence of complexing reagents it is easily oxidised.  (iii) The d1configuration is very unstable in ions.","(i) Cr2+is strongly reducing in nature. It has a d4configuration. While acting as a reducing agent, it gets oxidized to  Cr3+(electronic configuration, d3). This d3configuration can be written as   configuration, which is a more stable  configuration. In the case of Mn3+(d4), it acts as an oxidizing agent and gets reduced to Mn2+(d5). This has an exactly  half-filled d-orbital and is highly stable.  (ii) Co(II) is stable in aqueous solutions. However, in the presence of strong field complexing reagents, it is oxidized  to Co (III). Although the 3rdionization energy for Co is high, but the higher amount of crystal field stabilization energy  (CFSE) released in the presence of strong field ligands overcomes this ionization energy.  (iii) The ions in d1configuration tend to lose one more electron to get into stable d0configuration. Also, the hydration or  lattice energy is more than sufficient to remove the only electron present in the d-orbital of these ions. Therefore, they  act as reducing agents."
The Actinoids,What is meant by 'disproportionation'? Give two examples of disproportionation reaction in aqueous  solution.,"It is found that sometimes a relatively less stable oxidation state undergoes an oxidation - reduction reaction in which  it is simultaneously oxidised and reduced. This is called disproportionation.  Forexample,    Cr(V) is oxidized to Cr(VI) and reduced to Cr(III).          Mn (VI) is oxidized to Mn (VII) and reduced to Mn (IV)."
The Actinoids,Which metal in the first series of transition metals exhibits +1 oxidationstate most frequently and why?,"In the first transition series, Cu exhibits +1 oxidation state very frequently. It is because Cu ( +1) has an electronic  configuration of [Ar] 3d10. The completely filled d-orbital makes it highly stable."
Some Applications of d- and f-Block Elements,"Give examples and suggest reasons for the following features of the transition metal chemistry:  (i)The lowest oxide of transition metal is basic, the highest is amphoteric/acidic.  (ii)A transition metal exhibits highest oxidation state in oxides and fluorides.  (iii) The highest oxidation state is exhibited in oxoanions of a metal.","(i) In the case of a lower oxide of a transition metal, the metal atom has a low oxidation state. This means that some  of the valence electrons of the metal atom are not involved in bonding. As a result, it can donate electrons and  behave as a base.        On the other hand, in the case of a higher oxide of a transition metal, the metal atom has a high oxidation state. This  means that the valence electrons are involved in bonding and so, they are unavailable. There is also a high effective  nuclear charge.  As a result, it can accept electrons and behave as an acid.  For example,  is basic and  is acidic.  (ii) Oxygen and fluorine act as strong oxidising agents because of their high electronegativities and small sizes.  Hence, they bring out the highest oxidation states from the transition metals. In other words, a transition metal  exhibits higher oxidation states in oxides and fluorides. For example, in OsF6and V2O5, the oxidation states of Os and  V are +6 and +5 respectively.  (iii) Oxygen is a strong oxidising agent due to its high electronegativity and small size. So, oxo-anions of a metal  have the highest oxidation state. For example, in , the oxidation state of Mn is +7."

The Actinoids,The chemistry of the actinoid elements is not so smooth as that of the Lanthanoids. Justify this statement by  giving some examples from the oxidation state of these elements.,"Lanthanoids primarily show three oxidation states (+2, +3, +4). Among these oxidation states, +3 state is the most  common. Lanthanoids display a limited number of oxidation states because the energy difference between 4f, 5d,  and 6sorbitals is quite large. On the other hand, the energy difference between 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals is very less.  Hence, actinoids display a large number of oxidation states. For example, uranium and plutonium display +3, +4, +5,  and +6 oxidation states while neptunium displays +3, +4, +5, and +7. The most common oxidation state in case of  actinoids is also +3."
The Actinoids,Which is the last element in the series of the actinoids? Write the electronic configuration of this element.  Comment on the possible oxidation state of this element.,"The last element in the actinoid series is lawrencium, Lr. Its atomic number is 103 and its electronic configuration is .

Yb after forming Yb2+ attains a stable electronic configuration of [Xe] 4f14.
The Actinoids,Compare the chemistry of the actinoids with that of lanthanoids with reference to:  (i) electronic configuration  (ii) oxidation states and        (iii) chemical reactivity.,"Electronic configuration  The general electronic configuration for lanthanoids is [Xe]544f0-145d0-16s2and that for actinoids is [Rn]865f1-146d0-17s2.

The Actinoids,"Compare the general characteristics of the first series of the transition metals with those of the second and  third series metals in the respective vertical columns. Give special emphasis on the following points:  (i) electronic configurations,  (ii) oxidation states,        (iii) ionisation enthalpies, and  (iv) atomic sizes.","(i) In the 1st, 2ndand 3rdtransition series, the 3d, 4d and 5dorbitals are respectively filled.  We know that elements in the same vertical column generally have similar electronic configurations.  In the first transition series, two elements show unusual electronic configurations:    Similarly, there are exceptions in the second transition series. These are:      There are some exceptions in the third transition series as well. These are:    As a result of these exceptions, it happens many times that the electronic configurations of the elements present in  the same group are dissimilar.  (ii) In each of the three transition series the number of oxidation states shown by the elements is the maximum in the  middle and the minimum at the extreme ends.  However, +2 and +3 oxidation states are quite stable for all elements present in the first transition series. All metals  present in the first transition series form stable compounds in the +2 and +3 oxidation states. The stability of the +2  and +3 oxidation states decreases in the second and the third transition series, wherein higher oxidation states are  more important.  For example  are stable complexes, but no such complexes  are known for the second and third transition series such as Mo, W, Rh, In. They form complexes in which their  oxidation states are high. For example: WCl6, ReF7, RuO4, etc.  (iii) In each of the three transition series, the first ionisation enthalpy increases from left to right. However, there are  some exceptions. The first ionisation enthalpies of the third transition series are higher than those of the first and  second transition series. This occurs due to the poor shielding effect of 4felectrons in the third transition series.        Certain elements in the second transition series have higher first ionisation enthalpies than elements corresponding  to the same vertical column in the first transition series. There are also elements in the 2ndtransition series whose first  ionisation enthalpies are lower than those of the elements corresponding to the same vertical column in the  1sttransition series.  (iv) Atomic size generally decreases from left to right across a period. Now, among the three transition series, atomic  sizes of the elements in the second transition series are greater than those of the elements corresponding to the  same vertical column in the first transition series. However, the atomic sizes of the elements in the third transition  series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members in the second transition series. This is due to  lanthanoid contraction."

The Actinoids,Comment on the statement that elements of the first transition series possess many properties different from  those of heavier transition elements.    ,"The properties of the elements of the first transition series differ from those of the heavier transition elements in many  ways.  (i) The atomic sizes of the elements of the first transition series are smaller than those of the heavier elements  (elements of 2ndand 3rdtransition series).  However, the atomic sizes of the elements in the third transition series are virtually the same as those of the  corresponding members in the second transition series. This is due to lanthanoid contraction.  (ii) +2 and +3 oxidation states are more common for elements in the first transition series, while higher oxidation  states are more common for the heavier elements.  (iii) The enthalpies of atomisation of the elements in the first transition series are lower than those of the  corresponding elements in the second and third transition series.  (iv) The melting and boiling points of the first transition series are lower than those of the heavier transition elements.  This is because of the occurrence of stronger metallic bonding (M-M bonding).  (v) The elements of the first transition series form low-spin or high-spin complexes depending upon the strength of  the ligand field. However, the heavier transition elements form only low-spin complexes, irrespective of the strength of  the ligand field."

Therefore,    We can see from the above calculation that the given value is closest to . Also, in this complex, Mn is in the +2  oxidation state. This means that Mn has 5 electrons in the d-orbital.

Also, in this complex, Fe is in the +2  oxidation state. This means that Fe has 6 electrons in the d-orbital.

Also, in this complex, Mn is in the +2  oxidation state. This means that Mn has 5 electrons in the d-orbital.

Definitions of Some Important Terms,Explain on the basis of valence bond theory that [Ni(CN)4]2- ion with square  planar structure is diamagnetic and the [NiCl4]2- ion with tetrahedral geometry is paramagnetic.,"Ni is in the +2 oxidation state i.e., in d8 configuration.    There are 4 CN- ions. Thus, it can either have a tetrahedral geometry or square planar geometry. Since CN- ion is a  strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons.    It now undergoes dsp2 hybridization. Since all electrons are paired, it is diamagnetic.  In case of [NiCl4]2-, Cl- ion is a weak field ligand. Therefore, it does not lead to the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons.  Therefore, it undergoes sp3 hybridization.    Since there are 2 unpaired electrons in this case, it is paramagnetic in nature."
Definitions of Some Important Terms,[NiCl4]2- is paramagnetic while [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic though both are tetrahedral. Why?,"Though both [NiCl4]2- and [Ni(CO)4] are tetrahedral, their magnetic characters are different. This is due to a difference  in the nature of ligands. Cl- is a weak field ligand and it does not cause the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons. Hence,  [NiCl4]2-is paramagnetic.    In Ni(CO)4, Ni is in the zero oxidation state i.e., it has a configuration of 3d8 4s2.    But CO is a strong field ligand. Therefore, it causes the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons. Also, it causes the 4s  electrons to shift to the 3d orbital, thereby giving rise to sp3 hybridization. Since no unpaired electrons are present in  this case, [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic."

Therefore, there is only one unpaired  electron left in the d-orbital.    Therefore,    On the other hand, H2O is a weak field ligand. Therefore, it cannot cause the pairing of electrons. This means that the  number of unpaired electrons is 5.  Therefore,          Thus, it is evident that  is strongly paramagnetic, while  is weakly paramagnetic."

Therefore, Cobalt can  undergo d2sp3 hybridization.    Hence, it is an inner orbital complex.    If NH3 causes the pairing, then only one 3d orbital is  empty. Thus, it cannot undergo d2sp3 hybridization.  Therefore, it undergoes sp3d2 hybridization.    Hence, it forms an outer orbital complex."
Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds,Predict the number of unpaired electrons in the square planar [Pt(CN)4]2- ion.,"In this complex, Pt is in the +2 state. It forms a square planar structure.

Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds,Explain the bonding in coordination compounds in terms of Werner's postulates.,"Werner's postulates explain the bonding in coordination compounds as follows:  (i) A metal exhibits two types of valencies namely, primary and secondary valencies. Primary valencies are satisfied  by negative ions while secondary valencies are satisfied by both negative and neutral ions.  (In modern terminology, the primary valency corresponds to the oxidation number of the metal ion, whereas the  secondary valency refers to the coordination number of the metal ion.  (ii) A metal ion has a definite number of secondary valencies around the central atom. Also, these valencies project in  a specific direction in the space assigned to the definite geometry of the coordination compound.  (iii) Primary valencies are usually ionizable, while secondary valencies are non-ionizable."
Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds,FeSO4 solution mixed with (NH4)2SO4 solution in 1:1 molar ratio gives the test of Fe2+ ion but CuSO4solution  mixed with aqueous ammonia in 1:4 molar ratio does not give the test of Cu2+ ion. Explain why?,"Both the compounds i.e.,  and   fall under the  category of addition compounds with only one major difference i.e., the former is an example of a double salt, while  the latter is a coordination compound.  A double salt is an addition compound that is stable in the solid state but that which breaks up into its constituent ions  in the dissolved state. These compounds exhibit individual properties of their constituents. For  e.g.  breaks into Fe2+, NH4+, and SO4 2 - ions. Hence, it gives a positive test for  Fe2+ ions.  A coordination compound is an addition compound which retains its identity in the solid as well as in the dissolved  state. However, the individual properties of the constituents are lost. This happens  because   does not show the test for Cu2+. The ions present in the solution  of   are   and ."
Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds,"Explain with two examples each of the following: coordination entity, ligand, coordination number,  coordination polyhedron, homoleptic and heteroleptic.","(i) Coordination entity:  A coordination entity is an electrically charged radical or species carrying a positive or negative charge. In a  coordination entity, the central atom or ion is surrounded by a suitable number of neutral molecules or negative ions (  called ligands). For example:  = cationic complex  = anionic complex  = neutral complex  (ii) Ligands  The neutral molecules or negatively charged ions that surround the metal atom in a coordination entity or a coordinal  complex are known as ligands. For example, , Cl - , - OH. Ligands are usually polar in nature and  possess at least one unshared pair of valence electrons.  (iii) Coordination number:  The total number of ligands (either neutral molecules or negative ions) that get attached to the central metal atom in  the coordination sphere is called the coordination number of the central metal atom. It is also referred to as its  ligancy.  For example:  (a) In the complex, K2[PtCl6], there as six chloride ions attached to Pt in the coordinate sphere. Therefore, the  coordination number of Pt is 6.  (b) Similarly, in the complex [Ni(NH3)4]Cl2, the coordination number of the central atom (Ni) is 4.  (vi) Coordination polyhedron:  Coordination polyhedrons about the central atom can be defined as the spatial arrangement of the ligands that are  directly attached to the central metal ion in the coordination sphere. For example:  (a)    (b) Tetrahedral          (v) Homoleptic complexes:  These are those complexes in which the metal ion is bound to only one kind of a donor group. For  eg:   etc.  (vi) Heteroleptic complexes:  Heteroleptic complexes are those complexes where the central metal ion is bound to more than one type of a donor  group.  For e.g.:"
Definitions of Some Important Terms,"What is meant by unidentate, didentate and ambidentate ligands?

For e.g.,  , Cl - etc.  (b) Didentate ligands: Ligands that have two donor sites are called didentate ligands. For e.g.,  (a) Ethane-1,2-diamine    (b) Oxalate ion    (c) Ambidentate ligands:  Ligands that can attach themselves to the central metal atom through two different atoms are called ambidentate  ligands.

Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds,"List various types of isomerism possible for coordination compounds, giving an example of each.","(a) Geometric isomerism:  This type of isomerism is common in heteroleptic complexes. It arises due to the different possible geometric  arrangements of the ligands. For example:    (b) Optical isomerism:  This type of isomerism arises in chiral molecules. Isomers are mirror images of each other and are non- superimposable.          (c) Linkage isomerism: This type of isomerism is found in complexes that contain ambidentate ligands. For  example:  [Co(NH3)5 (NO2)]Cl2 and [Co(NH3)5 (ONO)Cl2  Yellow form Red form  (d) Coordination isomerism:  This type of isomerism arises when the ligands are interchanged between cationic and anionic entities of differnet  metal ions present in the complex.  [Co(NH3)6] [Cr(CN)6] and [Cr(NH3)6] [Co(CN)6]  (e) Ionization isomerism:  This type of isomerism arises when a counter ion replaces a ligand within the coordination sphere. Thus, complexes  that have the same composition, but furnish different ions when dissolved in water are called ionization isomers. For  e.g., Co(NH3)5SO4)Br and Co(NH3)5Br]SO4.

Fe2+ : Electronic configuration is 3d6  Orbitals of Fe2+ ion:          As CN- is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of the unpaired 3d electrons.    Since there are six ligands around the central metal ion, the most feasible hybridization is d2sp3.  d2sp3 hybridized orbitals of Fe2+ are:    6 electron pairs from CN- ions occupy the six hybrid d2sp3orbitals.  Then,    Hence, the geometry of the complex is octahedral and the complex is diamagnetic (as there are no unpaired  electrons).  (ii) [FeF6]3-  In this complex, the oxidation state of Fe is +3.  Orbitals of Fe+3 ion:    There are 6 F- ions. Thus, it will undergo d2sp3 or sp3d2 hybridization. As F- is a weak field ligand, it does not cause the  pairing of the electrons in the 3d orbital. Hence, the most feasible hybridization is sp3d2.  sp3d2 hybridized orbitals of Fe are:      Hence, the geometry of the complex is found to be octahedral.  (iii) [Co(C2O4)3]3-  Cobalt exists in the +3 oxidation state in the given complex.        Orbitals of Co3+ ion:    Oxalate is a weak field ligand. Therefore, it cannot cause the pairing of the 3d orbital electrons. As there are 6  ligands, hybridization has to be either sp3d2 or d2sp3 hybridization.  sp3d2 hybridization of Co3+:    The 6 electron pairs from the 3 oxalate ions (oxalate anion is a bidentate ligand) occupy these sp3d2 orbitals.    Hence, the geometry of the complex is found to be octahedral.  (iv) [CoF6]3-  Cobalt exists in the +3 oxidation state.  Orbitals of Co3+ ion:    Again, fluoride ion is a weak field ligand.

Bonding in Metal Carbonyls,What is crystal field splitting energy? How does the magnitude of Δo decide the actual configuration of d- orbitals in a coordination entity?,"The degenerate d-orbitals (in a spherical field environment) split into two levels i.e., eg and t2g in the presence of  ligands. The splitting of the degenerate levels due to the presence of ligands is called the crystal-field splitting while  the energy difference between the two levels (eg and t2g) is called the crystal-field splitting energy. It is denoted by Δo.  After the orbitals have split, the filling of the electrons takes place. After 1 electron (each) has been filled in the  three t2gorbitals, the filling of the fourth electron takes place in two ways. It can enter the eg orbital (giving rise  to t2g 3 eg 1 like electronic configuration) or the pairing of the electrons can take place in the t2g orbitals (giving rise  to t2g 4 eg 0 like electronic configuration). If the Δo value of a ligand is less than the pairing energy (P), then the electrons  enter the egorbital. On the other hand, if the Δo value of a ligand is more than the pairing energy (P), then the  electrons enter the t2gorbital."
Bonding in Metal Carbonyls,[Cr(NH3)6]3+ is paramagnetic while [Ni(CN)4]2- is diamagnetic. Explain why?,"Cr is in the +3 oxidation state i.e., d3 configuration. Also, NH3 is a weak field ligand that does not cause the pairing of  the electrons in the 3d orbital.  Cr3+    Therefore, it undergoes d2sp3 hybridization and the electrons in the 3d orbitals remain unpaired. Hence, it is  paramagnetic in nature.  In [Ni(CN)4]2-, Ni exists in the +2 oxidation state i.e., d8 configuration.  Ni2+:    CN- is a strong field ligand. It causes the pairing of the 3d orbital electrons. Then, Ni2+ undergoes dsp2 hybridization.    As there are no unpaired electrons, it is diamagnetic."
Bonding in Metal Carbonyls,A solution of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ is green but a solution of [Ni(CN)4]2- is colourless. Explain.,"In [Ni(H2O)6]2+,   is a weak field ligand. Therefore, there are unpaired electrons in Ni2+. In this complex,  the delectrons from the lower energy level can be excited to the higher energy level i.e., the possibility of d -  d transition is present. Hence, Ni(H2O)6]2+ is coloured.  In [Ni(CN)4]2 - , the electrons are all paired as CN- is a strong field ligand. Therefore, d-d transition is not possible in  [Ni(CN)4]2 - . Hence, it is colourless."
Bonding in Metal Carbonyls,[Fe(CN)6]4- and [Fe(H2O)6]2+ are of different colours in dilute solutions. Why?,"The colour of a particular coordination compound depends on the magnitude of the crystal-field splitting energy, Δ.  This CFSE in turn depends on the nature of the ligand. In case of [Fe(CN)6]4- and [Fe(H2O)6]2+, the colour differs  because there is a difference in the CFSE. Now, CN- is a strong field ligand having a higher CFSE value as compared  to the CFSE value of water. This means that the absorption of energy for the intra d-d transition also differs. Hence,  the transmitted colour also differs."
Importance and Applications of Coordination Compounds,Discuss the nature of bonding in metal carbonyls.,"The metal-carbon bonds in metal carbonyls have both ÃÆ’ and Ãâ‚¬ characters. A ÃÆ’ bond is formed when the  carbonyl carbon donates a lone pair of electrons to the vacant orbital of the metal. A Ãâ‚¬ bond is formed by the  donation of a pair of electrons from the filled metal d orbital into the vacant anti-bonding Ãâ‚¬* orbital (also known as  back bonding of the carbonyl group). The ÃÆ’ bond strengthens the Ãâ‚¬ bond and vice-versa. Thus, a synergic  effect is created due to this metal-ligand bonding. This synergic effect strengthens the bond between CO and the  metal."

Importance and Applications of Coordination Compounds,What is meant by stability of a coordination compound in solution?

Stability can be expressed quantitatively in terms of stability constant or formation constant.      For this reaction, the greater the value of the stability constant, the greater is the proportion of ML3 in the solution.  Stability can be of two types:  (a) Thermodynamic stability:  The extent to which the complex will be formed or will be transformed into another species at the point of equilibrium  is determined by thermodynamic stability.  (b) Kinetic stability:  This helps in determining the speed with which the transformation will occur to attain the state of equilibrium.  Factors that affect the stability of a complex are:  (a) Charge on the central metal ion: Thegreater the charge on the central metal ion, the greater is the stability of  the complex.  2.  Basic nature of the ligand: A more basic ligand will form a more stable complex.  2.  Presence of chelate rings: Chelation increases the stability of complexes."
